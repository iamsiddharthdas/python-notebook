Arithmetic Operators:

Addition:       3 + 2
Subtraction:    3 - 2
Multiplication: 3 * 2
Division:       3 / 2
Floor Division: 3 // 2  (extracts the integer value from the float)
Exponent:       3 ** 2
Modulus:        3 % 2

Comparision Operators: 
Equal:            3 == 2
Not Equal:        3 != 2
Greater than:     3 > 2
Less than:        3 < 2
Greater or Equal: 3 >= 2
Less or Equal:    3 <= 2


num = 2
num += 1 -> it means num = num+1 which prints 3 i.e. 2+1

print(abs(-3)) -> prints 3 which is absoulte value of -3 i.e |-3| = 3
print(round(3.75)) -> prints 4 which is rounded up value of 3.75
print(round(3.75, 1)) -> prints 3.8 as it rounds value of 3.75 to 1st decimal digit.

'''
# Simple boolean logic
num1=2
num2=2

print(num1==num2)#prints true
print(num1>num2)#prints false


# Concantenate (typecast str->int for arithmetic operations)

num_1 = '100'
num_2 = '200'

num_1 = int(num_1)
num_2 = int(num_2)
# without this, it will print 100200 -> will concantenate as strings

print(num_1 + num_2) #prints 300



# Modulus operator (example)

'''

x = 50
x %= 70 i.e x = x % 70 -> x = 50 % 70

print(x) -> prints 50

if a<b
a % b = a

'''


# Logical operators

'''

Null 

Integer -> 0
Float -> 0.0000
string -> " "
Boolean -> False
None (no type)


so print(not 0) -> True ( its null value)
print(not -15) -> False (its not null)
print(not " ")-> True
print(not 0.0000) -> True


and/or -> multiple condition

Special operator -> is, isNot
Membership operator -> in Notin
